            <h2>Gunpla Grades Explained</h2>
            <p>
                Gunpla kits come in various grades, each offering a different level of complexity and detail. It's important to remember that the grade does not determine the quality of the kit. Here's an overview of the main Gunpla grades:
            </p>
            <h3>Entry Grade (EG)</h3>
            <p>
                Entry Grade kits are the easiest to build and require no tools. They're perfect for absolute beginners or young builders. Despite their simplicity, they often feature good articulation and decent detail.
            </p>
            <h3>High Grade (HG)</h3>
            <p>
                High Grade kits offer a good balance of detail, affordability, and ease of assembly. They're great for beginners and experienced builders alike. HG kits come in 1/144 scale and feature a wide variety of mobile suits.
            </p>
            <h3>Real Grade (RG)</h3>
            <p>
                Real Grade kits provide a high level of detail in a compact 1/144 scale. They feature an inner frame and more complex assembly, making them suitable for builders with some experience.
            </p>
            <h3>Master Grade (MG)</h3>
            <p>
                Master Grade kits are larger (1/100 scale) and more detailed. They offer a more complex build experience with a full inner frame and more gimmicks. MG kits are great for experienced builders looking for a challenge.
            </p>
            <h3>Perfect Grade (PG)</h3>
            <p>
                Perfect Grade kits are the largest (usually 1/60 scale) and most detailed Gunpla kits available. They offer the ultimate building experience with intricate details, LED features, and complex mechanics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, the grade you choose depends on your skill level, interests, and the time you want to invest in building. Don't be afraid to try different grades as you progress in your Gunpla journey!
